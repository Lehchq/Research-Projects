## 📌 Background
Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, have gained popularity as potential study aids in medical education. However, the question remains: **does using AI alongside traditional lectures improve or hinder knowledge retention?**

---

## 🧪 Methods
- **Participants:** 26 residents divided into two groups:  
  - **Regular** (traditional study + lecture)  
  - **AI** (study + ChatGPT 3.5 assistance + lecture)  

- **Procedure:**  
  1. Both groups answered 6 clinical questions (plus demographics).  
  2. Regular group: answered before and 1 month after the lecture.  
  3. AI group: answered once, then with ChatGPT, and repeated the test after 1 month (without AI).  
  4. Statistical analysis: Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ) and T-test.

---

## 📊 Results
- **Completion:** 21 residents completed the post-lecture test (12 AI, 9 regular).  
- **AI correlation:** Weak, non-significant positive correlation between AI usage frequency and performance (ρ = 0.34, p = 0.26).  
- **PGY level correlation:** Moderate positive correlation with correct answers without AI (ρ = 0.53, p = 0.0057).  
- **Knowledge growth:** The **regular group** showed a greater increase in correct answers post-lecture than the AI group (t = -3.81, p = 0.00042).

---

## ✅ Conclusion
- AI may be useful as a **supplemental** study tool.  
- However, **exclusive reliance on AI may negatively impact knowledge retention**.  
- Caution is advised when integrating AI tools into medical education.
